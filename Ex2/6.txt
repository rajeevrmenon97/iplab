Addition:
The first image is superimposed over the second image.
Subtraction:
Similar effect to addition is observed with superimposition. But the image is a bit darker. Subtraction can be used to detect changes between two images.
Multiplication by constant factor:
When constant factor is greater than one, multiplication brightens the image. Natural brightening is observed as the relative contrast is preserved.
Division by constant factor:
When constant factor is greater than one, division darkens the image. Similar to multiplication relative contrast is preserved.
