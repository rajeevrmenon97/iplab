Applying the Discrete Fourier Transform twice to a signal, produced the original signal in a circularly reversed and linearly scaled by N form, as the Inverse Discrete Fourier transform is very similar to Forward Discrete Fourier transform except in a simple weight by N and the sign of the complex exponential, which reflects itself in the reversal of the original signal. This is known as the Duality Property of DFT.
