After the fourier transform is calculated from real domain to complex domain, It's observed that the dynamic range of Fourier coefficients is too large to be displayed on screen.All the values obtained appeared black. 
After applying logarthmic transformation the following image is obtained. The result shows that the image contains components of all frequencies, but that their magnitude gets smaller for higher frequencies. Hence, low frequencies contain more image information than the higher ones. The transform image also tells us that there are two dominating directions in the Fourier image, one passing vertically and one horizontally through the center. These originate from the regular patterns in the background of the original image.
After calculating the angle from real and imaginary parts of the coefficients the phase spectrum is obtained. The value of each point determines the phase of the corresponding frequency. As in the magnitude image, we can identify the vertical and horizontal lines corresponding to the patterns in the original image. The phase image does not yield much new information about the structure of the spatial domain image.
Performing inverse fourier transform on it results in the original image.
Doubling the magnitude spectrum does not make any change in the logarthmic transformation of the spectrum. So it remains identical to the original magnitude spectrum.
After removing the phase component, if we perform inverse fourier transform on the magnitude spectrum the following image is obtained. Although this image contains the same frequencies (and amount of frequencies) as the original input image, it is corrupted beyond recognition. This shows that the phase information is crucial to reconstruct the correct image in the spatial domain.
